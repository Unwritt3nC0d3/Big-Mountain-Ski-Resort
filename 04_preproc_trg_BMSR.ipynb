    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Using the KISS approach (Keep It Simple Stupid) to all problem solving.  The first test run to determine where we stand on pricing is to compare Big Mountain's mean price to it's competitors. Using the mean approach approach, we've determined that the average price is $61.  However, we also then have to determine how \"good\" the mean (or average) approach is.  To do this we measure the R2, or coefficient of determination, the MAE, mean absolute error, and the MSE, mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAE and MSE are commonly used methods of evaluating the performance of regression models.  The MAE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values.  The MAE also provides a measure of the average of the size of the errors.  A lower MAE indicates that the model should have better performance, with a value of zero indicating a model that makes perfect predictions.  The MAE for our model is approximately 19.  This means that on average our model will be about $19 off.  The MSE on the other hand measures the average squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.  Like the MAE, a lower MSE indicates better model performance, again zero is a perfect model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a cross validation process was used to assess the performance of the predictive model.  Cross-validation is a method that provides a deeper estimate of the model's performance compared to a single train-test split. By averaging various performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error) across the model, cross-validation reduces variability in the performance estimate and provides a more reliable assessment of the model's ability to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then manipulated our data through imputing missing values and prepared it for review using regression models. More advanced regression analysis beyond a mean comparison is necessary because there are dozens of factors that impact ticket prices. Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between one or more independent variables (skiable terrain, night skiing, etc) and a dependent variable (ticket price). There were two primary models used for our regression analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first regression test that we performed was a linear regression model.  The R-squared score of approximately 0.844 on the training set indicates that the linear regression model explains about 84.4% of the variance in the target variable in the training data. Overall, the linear regression model appears to perform reasonably well, but there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the prediction errors on the test set. Further analysis, tuning of hyperparameters, or exploring more complex models may be necessary to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest Model regression was then applied. The average cross-validated score of approximately 0.680 indicates that, on average, the model explains around 68% of the variance in the target variable across different subsets of the data. The standard deviation of approximately 0.094 suggests that there is some variability in the model's performance across folds, indicating potential instability or sensitivity to the choice of training data subsets. Overall, the random forest regression model pipeline appears to perform reasonably well based on the cross-validation results. However, further analysis and evaluation may be needed, such as comparing it with other models and assessing its performance on a holdout test set, to determine its suitability for the specific task and dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear Regression:\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "-The MAE on the test set is slightly lower compared to its cross-validated MAE, suggesting good generalization performance.\n",
    "-Linear regression models are simpler and easier to interpret compared to random forests.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "-The cross-validated MAE on the training data is higher compared to random forest regression.\n",
    "-Linear regression models may struggle to capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regression:\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "-The cross-validated MAE on the training data is slightly lower compared to linear regression.\n",
    "-Random forests tend to handle complex relationships well and are less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "-The MAE on the test set is slightly higher compared to its cross-validated MAE on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both models have their strengths and weaknesses. The linear regression model is simple and easy to interpret. However, the random forest regression is more accurate can capture relationships in the data. For the purposes of Big Mountain Ski Resort, the random forest regression is recommended."
